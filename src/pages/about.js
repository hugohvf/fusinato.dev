      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hugo, developer who loves challenges and always curious to understand how tech works.
      </p>

      <p>
        What gets me going is building great products for users while keeping code clean and efficient. I enjoy collaborating with team members to bring the best solution to life. 
      </p>

      <p>
        My current focus is on microservices and scalable systems, but over the years I have accumulated extensive experience with front end and back end web development. When my company uses a new language or tech stack I always learn fast. I am constantly searching for new updates on tech that could be useful in the products I am working on.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked at startups, small companies, and large corporations, and know how to adapt to each environment.
